# Simple Counter Project

This project is a basic counter application built using HTML, CSS (for styling), and JavaScript. It allows users to increment and decrement a counter value by clicking buttons. The current count is displayed on the page and updates dynamically.

## Features
- **Increment Button**: Increases the counter value by 1.
- **Subtract Button**: Decreases the counter value by 1.
- The counter is displayed in an `<h1>` element and updates in real time when buttons are clicked.

## Structure
- **HTML**: Defines the structure, including the buttons and the `<h1>` element that displays the count.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic of the increment and decrement actions, updating the display accordingly.
  
## How It Works
1. The user clicks the "ADD" button, which calls the `increment()` function and increases the counter.
2. The user clicks the "subtract" button, which calls the `subtract()` function and decreases the counter.
3. The updated count is immediately reflected in the `<h1>` element with the ID `h1`.

## Example
- Initial count: `0`
- After clicking "ADD": count becomes `1`
- After clicking "subtract": count becomes `0` again

This is a simple example of how HTML and JavaScript can be used together to create an interactive web feature.
